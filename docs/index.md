# What is LocalChat?

LocalChat is an AI chatbot that can analyse, summarise, translate, and answer questions given text-based documents as
input.

The app differentiates itself from other LLM services by running entirely locally within the user's web-browser.
The app does make any requests over the local-network or the internet - ensuring that your data exists only 
within your local device, and that the processing is sand-boxed and contained within the browser environment.

Additionally, the app does not require any software dependencies to run, making it ideal for use cases where 
confidentiality is of utmost importance.

This project was started as a university student project in collaboration with DEWC Services.
