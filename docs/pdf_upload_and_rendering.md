# Status Update – PDF Upload & Worker Initialization

We’ve integrated the core PDF upload workflow into a test (non-release) version of the web app and discovered a issue in how PDF.js initializes its worker process, which in this case is responsible for **parsing** PDF content into rendering instructions and readable/usable text data.

Firstly, the file‐upload is fully functional. Users can now select and submit PDFs through the interface, The `parsePDFFileAsync(file)` utility reliably reads each page’s text, and `logPdfAsHtml(file)` correctly logs both the canvas markup and the text‐layer overlay HTML. We can see each page’s **visual layer** render—canvas dimensions and drawing commands display as expected. And the **text‐layer overlay** (absolute position of `<span>` elements generated in `logPdfAsHtml`) appears once `getTextContent()` runs.

However, when PDF.js attempts to spawn its dedicated worker thread (via the bundled `pdf.worker.mjs` set in `GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc`), it fails to load the script. This is likely due to an incorrect path. PDF.js then falls back to its in‐process “fake worker,” which executes the same parsing logic on the main thread.

### Console errors and descriptions 

#### Worker Bootstrap Failure  
- `Error: cannot load worker script at [path]`, indicating `GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc` is possibly misconfigured.  
#### Font & Glyph Fallbacks 
  Warnings about missing glyphs and font substitutions during parsing—these affect text metrics but again, isn't the cause of the worker load failure.  
#### Silent Fake‐Worker Fallback 
- “Using fake worker” messages without a console error dump, because PDF.js suppresses the original exception by design.

### Next Steps

#### Worker Script Verification
- Double-check `pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = new URL('pdf.worker.mjs', import.meta.url).toString();` in `filereaders.js`.  
- Confirm that `pdf.worker.mjs` is properly copied into `dist/`.
#### Robust Worker Initialization  
- Wrap the worker-spawn in a `try/catch` around `getDocument({ data: arrayBuffer })` to log path errors.  
- Try an inline Blob-URL worker fallback (`new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([workerCode])))`) to bypass bundler path resolution.  
#### Enhanced Error Handling 
- In `parsePDFFileAsync`, add `try/catch` around each `pdf.getPage(i)` and `page.getTextContent()` call to capture and report failures.  
- Override the fake-worker fallback by listening on `PDFWorker` errors or setting `disableWorker: true` temporarily to force sync errors to surface.
